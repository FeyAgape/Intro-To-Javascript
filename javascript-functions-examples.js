//Functions are reusable code.
//Functions allow you to package up lines of code that you can use (and often reuse) in your programs
//Parameters are variables that are used to store the data that's passed into a function for the function to use. 
//Arguments are the actual data that's passed into a function when it is invoked:
//Sometimes they take parameters
//parameter is listed as a variable after the function name, inside the parentheses. 
//And, if there were multiple parameters, you would just separate them with commas.

//e.g
function doubleGreeting(name, otherName) {
  // code to greet two people!

//example 1

// accepts no parameters! parentheses are empty
// declares the sayHello function

If an identifier is declared in global scope, it's available everywhere.
If an identifier is declared in function scope, it's available in the function it was declared in (even in functions declared inside the function).
When trying to access an identifier, the JavaScript Engine will first look in the current function. If it doesn't find anything, it will continue to the next outer function to see if it can find the identifier there. It will keep doing this until it reaches the global scope.
Global identifiers are a bad idea. They can lead to bad variable names, conflicting variable names, and messy code.
